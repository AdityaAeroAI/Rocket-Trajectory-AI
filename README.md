Simulating rocket trajectory with physics and AI corrections (Aerospace + AI Project)
# Rocket Trajectory AI Project

This project simulates a basic rocket flight trajectory using physics principles.  
In upcoming phases, AI will be integrated to adapt the trajectory dynamically under wind disturbances.
