# AI-Powered Dynamic Rocket Trajectory Planner

This project simulates and optimizes rocket trajectories by combining classical physics with AI-powered prediction and wind disruption modeling.

## Project Goals

- Build a physics-based rocket flight simulator
- Introduce environmental factors such as wind disruption
- Use AI techniques to predict and optimize trajectories
- Provide clear visualizations comparing different flight scenarios

## Contents

- `rocket_trajectory_wind_comparison_sim.py`: Simulation comparing rocket trajectories with and without wind disruption
- Additional modules for AI-based optimization (coming soon)
